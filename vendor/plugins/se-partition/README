== Partition Plugin

This plugin uses native database techniques to partition tables based on field values.

Currently this plugin only works for Postgres and will only partition based on a date or string field.

== Installation

script/plugin install git://github.com/ss/se-partition.git

== Example migration

class CreateUser < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def self.up
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end
    add_index :users, :created_at

    # Partition user table by week
    SE::Partition.partition(User, :created_at, :interval => 'week', :verbose => false)
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :users
  end
end

== Postgres Notes

The postgres code was heavily borrowed from: http://valgogtech.blogspot.com/2008/04/table-partitioning-automation-triggers.html

In order for postgres partitioning to work most effectively, you need to make sure you have 
constraint_exclusion set to 'on' or 'partition' in your postgresql.conf

You'll also need to add the following monkey-patch:

  class ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter
    # partition triggers can't return values. :(
    def supports_insert_with_returning?
      false
    end
  end
